# images
- images must be saved
- we can attach them in the post using file attacher or something like that but what will we do with on the server side 
  - "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43013858/how-to-post-a-file-from-a-form-with-axios"
  - we can save the file to the server in a specific folder with a randomly generated/ time generated name 
  - then we can save the location and name of that file in the data base
  - this will save space and prevent us from saving a massive string for each file
